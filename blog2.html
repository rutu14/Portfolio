        <p>An ancient book that instructs you how to live your life. What drew me to this book? A thought that occurs to me as I write this page. The book's setting is based on a fight between relatives. The major outcome is that good triumphs over evil, but doesn't every literature and narrative on the planet state this? 
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>So far, the best explanation I've heard is<strong>"Conquer your Fears"</strong>. When Arjuna is undecided about fighting the adharma,  Krishna tells him the verses. This helps to conquer his fears.  This notion made me realise that your weaknesses/failures are only there to help you succeed if you work on them.</p>        
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Leaving one's comfort zone is undoubtedly difficult. So, with a head full of ideas and plans, I want to overcome my few worries. Well, it all started with this page, which was my first step in chronicling my thoughts.</p>
